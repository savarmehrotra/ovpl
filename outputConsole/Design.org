* Proposed Design To Build The Output Console

** Functionlity  
   The Output Console will display of the current status of the deployment
   process.The logs would be displayed to the Auto Deployment Service user 
   on the initate Deployment page.

** Technologies to be used
   + Tornado framework on the server end.
   + websockets for continuous connection. 
   + Java Script on the client end.

** Working of Web Sockets

** A bit about WebSockets
WebSocket is a tool that makes online development easier. In simple terms, it¡¯s
a protocol that opens up a full duplex (two way) connection using a TCP
internet connection. Before the invention of WebSocket, programs running over
the internet had to circumvent to the connection, often including a client-side
and server-side portion of each program, making it a difficult and time
consuming process. It¡¯s important to note that WebSocket doesn¡¯t overwrite the
standard HTTP protocols, it merely compliments them with the ability to forge a
direct two-way connection between user and server.
