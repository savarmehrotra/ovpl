#+TITLE:     CentOSVZAdapter for ADS
#+AUTHOR:    VLEAD   
#+DATE:      2015-04-07 Tue

* Introduction
An adapter is an ADS component, which is responsible for creating and
managing VMs on a particular platform. 

The =CentOSVZAdapter= is an adapter for the CentOS OpenVZ platform. In
this documentation, the term =VM= and =container= are used interchangeably.

* Functional Requirements
 
  1. =CentOSVZAdapter= will create a container on CentOS OpenVZ platform based on the specification
     given in the lab spec of a particular lab.

  2. =CentOSVZAdapter= will copy the =ADS code=  to the newly
     created container and start the =VMManager= service.
     
* Design
=CentOSVZAdapter= is required to create, start, stop and restart the
container but in the current release, it creates container and
intializes the =VMManager= service.

=CentOSVZAdapter= works by issuing the bunch of commands to =create=,
=set= and =start= the VM. It utilizes the =vzctl= commands to =create=
containers and base machine executes the commands through =ssh=.

** Interfaces
In the current design of =ADS=, a fixed set of interfaces to an adapter
is already defined. An adapter is required to implement these
interfaces. This enables other components/services of =ADS= to
communicate with the adapter. The interfaces implemented by the
=CentOSVZAdapter= are listed below:

1. *create_vm* (self, lab_spec, vm_id="")   
     Creates a new VM.
 
     *Parameters*: 
                 + lab_spec - Lists the lab and VM related reqirements.
                 + vm_id - If no vm_id is specified, it is computed using the last two segments of an available IP address.

     *Returns*: VM id of the newly created VM.

2. *start_vm* (self, vm_id)
     
     Starts the VM identified by =vm_id=.

     *Parameters*:
                 + vm_id - vm_id of the VM to be started.
    
     *Returns*: List of VMs that got started.


3. *start_vm_manager* (self, vm_id )
    
     Starts the VM manager service inside the VM identified by =vm_id=.
     
     *Parameters*:
                 + vm_id - VM id of the VM to be started.
     
     *Returns*: True if the VM Manager service has successfully started.     



* Configuration 

** Set the proxies:
1) To set the proxies, edit the file =ovpl/config/config.json= and
   =ovpl/src/VMManager/config.json=.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
"ENVIRONMENT": { "HTTP_PROXY":"http://proxy.vlabs.ac.in:8080", "HTTPS_PROXY":"http://proxy.vlabs.ac.in:8080" },
#+END_EXAMPLE

if no proxies are used,
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
"ENVIRONMENT": { "HTTP_PROXY":"", "HTTPS_PROXY":"" },
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Set the Base Machine details:
Also set the SERVER_IP in LOGSERVER_CONFIGURATION to the IP address of
the machine on which the ADS services are running.

Edit the file ovpl/src/adapters/settings.py 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
If the services are running on the base machine,
set ADS_ON_CONTAINER to False.

If the services are running on a container,
set ADS_ON_CONTAINER to True.

Set BASE_IP_ADDRESS = "root@<IP>" where IP is the ip address of
base machine on which containers are created.

Set ADS_SERVER_VM_ID to CTID of container running ADS.
ADS_SERVER_VM_ID = "<CTID>" 

SUBNET field to match with the subnet of your base machine
If the ip address of your base machine is 10.2.58.XXX, 
SUBNET = ["10.2.58.12/28"]
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Share the public key:
SSH access using key based authentication is allowed on base
machine. so to run the test case, public ssh key should be placed
inside the authorized_keys.

Create public key on container using:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ssh-keygen
#+END_EXAMPLE

Copy public key from =~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub= of local machine and paste
the copied public key in authorized_keys =~./ssh/authorized_keys= of
Base Machine.

** Scenario of CentOSVZAdapter

The following sequence diagram depicts the work flow for creation and
intilization of the VM. It takes the lab spec through http
request and creates the VM. =CentOSVZAdapter= returns =vm_id=, =vm_ip= and
=vm_manager_port= as a http response to the =VMPoolmanager=.

[[./sequence-diagram-of-centos-openvzadapter.png]]

Following is the sequence of events that occur when a lab is deployed
on CentOS platform using =CentOSVZAdapter=:

1) =VMPoolManager= sends an HTTP Request to =AdapterServer= indicating
   that a VM needs to be created. It also passes the lab spec that
   includes VM requirements.

2) On receiving this request, the =AdapterServer= calls the =create_vm()=
   function of =CentOSVZAdapter= and hands over the lab spec to it.

3) Based on lab spec, the =CentOSVZAdapter= selects OS template.

4) It creates a VM on Base Machine.

5) The =vm_id= of the newly created VM is returned to the
   =AdapterServer=.

6) The =AdapterServer= now calls the =init_vm()= function of =CentOSVZAdapter=.

7) This initializes the newly created VM on =CentOSVZAdapter= by copying
   relevant =ADS= component (VM Manager) and lab sources, and starting
   the VM Manager.

8) Once this service has started, the =CentOSVZAdapter= sends back
   =vm_id= of the VM, =vm_ip= of the VM and
   port on which the VM Manager service is running to =AdapterServer=.

9) Later three parameters (vm_id, vm_ip, vm_manager_port) are
   forwarded by =AdapterServer= as HTTP response to the =VMPoolManager=.

* Implementation
The implementation of the =CentOSVZAdapter= can be found [[../src/adapters/CentOSVZAdapter.py][here]].

* Testing
** Objective
+ To validate the creation of a VM.
+ To validate the intilization of a VM.
+ To ensure that the =VMManagerService= is running on this VM.

This is achieved through unit testing.
** Testing Environment

1. A VM is provisioned on Base Machine, such that it is able to access the
   internet.  
2) Edit the =config.json= and =setting.py= as
   mention above in [[configuration]].
3) =ADS= is configured and running in the provisioned VM.
4) Share the =public key= as metioned above in [[configuration]].

** Test Cases
*** Case 01: Creation of a VM
The objective of this test case is to test the creation of a VM on
Base Machine. =test_create_vm()= is responsible for testing the
creation of VM and returns =vm_id=. A VM will be created in this test
scenario and the creation is tested by pinging =vm_id=. 

*** Case 02: Intialization of VM 
The objective of this test is to validate the intialization of a VM on
Base Machine. =test_init_vm()= is responsible for testing the
intilization of VM. It returns =vm_ip=, =vm_id=, =vmm_port= and return
the status as boolean value.

*** Case 03: Checking if VMManager service is running successfully
After the VM is initialized, it is necessary to validate if the
VMManager sevice is running or not. It returns the status as boolean value.

*** Implementation of test cases
The implementation code for all above test case scenarios can be found [[https://github.com/vlead/ovpl/blob/openvz-adapter/tests/test_openvz_adapter.py][here]].
